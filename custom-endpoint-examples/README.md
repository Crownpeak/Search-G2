## Crownpeak SearchG2 Custom Endpoint Best Practice Examples

Customers may may want to insert data directly into a Solr collection rather than being required to pass it through Crownpeak DXM. For this purpose Crownpeak provides SearchG2 Custom Endpoints.

## Crownpeak Search Custom Endpoint Content Architecture

Crownpeak Search G2 Custom Endpoints work by restricting access to an entire Crownpeak Search G2 Collection. In order to interact with Crownpeak Search G2 Custom Endpoints, a request **MUST** be made:

* Using HTTPS (i.e. https://searchg2.crownpeak.net/{crownpeak_searchg2_collection_name}/{query};
* Using TLS1.2;
* Supplying both the correct client username and password to the request.

If any of the above conditions are not met, the request will be met with an "Access Denied" page, and 403 (Forbidden) response code.

## Examples

As SearchG2 Custom Endpoints grant the user access to the full range of Solr functionality, a detailed introduction is beyond the scope of this document. In-depth documentation is available at the official [Solr website](https://lucene.apache.org/Solr/guide/6.6/) including a [Getting Started](https://lucene.apache.org/Solr/guide/6_6/getting-started.html#getting-started) guide.

[API Clients](https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/6_6/client-apis.html) are available for use with many of the most popular languages including C#, Java and Python.

However, if you are using JavaScript then requests can be send to Solr using the standard XMLHttpRequest (XHR) object, and the request easily-parsed as JSON by adding 'wt=json' to the request URL.

In order to keep these examples very simple, we're going to use the standard command-line utility of cURL

### Adding a single document
    curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -u username:password 'https://searchg2.crownpeak.net/{crownpeak_searchg2_collection_name}/update' --data-binary '
    [
        {
            "id": "1",
            "title": "Doc 1",
            "url": "http://pageUrl1"
        }
    ]'

### Adding multiple documents
    curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -u username:password 'https://searchg2.crownpeak.net/{crownpeak_searchg2_collection_name}/update' --data-binary '
    [
        {
            "id": "1",
            "title": "Doc 1",
            "url": "http://pageUrl1"
        },
        {
            "id": "2",
            "title": "Doc 2",
            "url": "http://pageUrl2"
        }
    ]'
 
***
_Note: standard Solr options that enable the user to change the functionality of both 'optimize' and 'commit'-type (e.g. 'commit', 'commitWithin' and so on) commands are ignored by SearchG2 Custom Endpoints, and system defaults are used instead)._

_An update command containing:
    `{ ..
        "commitWithin": 5000','"optimize": {"waitSearcher: false"}' ..
    }` will be treated the same as `{ "commit": {} }`

### Deleting documents 
Delete operations are simpler than update operations and require that the JSON message requires the id or ids to be listed after the delete command:
    
    curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -u username:password 'https://searchg2.crownpeak.net/{crownpeak_searchg2_collection_name}/update' --data-binary '
        { "delete": {"id": "id1"} }'
    
    curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -u username:password 'https://searchg2.crownpeak.net/{crownpeak_searchg2_collection_name}/update' --data-binary '
        { "delete": ["id1", "id2"] }'
